# Life stack / Onebag

The hardware and software I use for getting things done.

It's like frugality, but for cm^3Â instead of dollars

## Goals

1. Avoid ecosystems. Find services that do one thing well. Easier to substitute them later on if they break or you find something better.
2. Avoid proprietary formats, maximize ease of migration
3. Store personal data in a synced folder that apps read from
4. Avoid accounts
